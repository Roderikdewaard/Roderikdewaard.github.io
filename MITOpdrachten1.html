					<tr><td><i>The point of this activity is to start thinking about what it means for an interface to be usable. At right is a familiar user interface design:
List some of the aspects of this design that have good usability, and some that have poor usability. Think about the aspects of usability we've discussed (learnability, memorability, efficiency, errors, satisfaction), and write down which aspect(s) of usability are involved in each good or bad point you cite.
</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>
•	Learnability: Because you will be using the same way to lock (setting a certain amount of numbers to lock it, and using the same numbers to unlock it) I think this is easy enough to learn, and generally won't give any user problems. <br>
•	Memorability: Device itself is not hard to remember how to use. The numbers you set can be meaningful ones, making it easy for you to remember.<br>
•	Efficiency: Rotating features require an unnatural movement for the wrists and arms. Takes time to unlock, there is no fast way, trying to unlock at a speedy rate will increase likeliness of making errors.<br>
•	Errors: Device is prone to errors. If you rotate the lock further than intended, you'll have to start all over again.Possibly even worse: you will mess up the code you are setting, changing it to something you might not remember.<br>
•	Satisfaction:  While easy to use and remember, this device is quite prone to errors and might not be very satisfying to the user.<br>
