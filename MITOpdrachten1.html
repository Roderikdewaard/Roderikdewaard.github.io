					<tr><td> <b>What am I supposed to do?</b><br><br><i>The goal of this activity is to think about how to design interfaces for learnability.<br>
Recall the thermostat example from lecture: some people believe that you can heat a room faster by setting the thermostat to a higher temperature than you really want, as if the thermostat were a valve for the heating system that lets more heat into the room the higher you set it. In fact, the thermostat is simply an on/off switch for the heat. It turns on as long as the room temperature is below the thermostat setting, and turns off when the thermostat setting is reached.<br><br>
Design a thermostat user interface that communicates its conceptual model to the user more effectively, so that users are less likely to make this mistake. Sketch your idea on a whiteboard, but don't stop with your first design. Critique it, and generate more designs. Don't worry too much about size, cost, difficulty of installation, or other tradeoffs. Certainly don't feel constrained by the old-fashioned thermostat design pictured at right. Be creative, and remember that we're focusing on usability in this class.
A few things to think about:<br>
•	Would it be enough to just print an explanation on the thermostat? If so, what exactly would it say?<br>
•	A sink faucet is normally a valve, so turning it farther will make the sink fill up faster. Suppose you came across a sink faucet which was just an on/off switch. As a user, how could you tell right away?<br>
•	Suppose you think you have a good design. How, specifically, would you test it?<br>

<tr><td colspan="2"><b>What I came up with after thinking for a while:</b><br><br>
•	In my opinion printing an explanation onto the thermostat wouldn't suffice for the simple fact every single person using the thermostat for the first time would have to read the explanation, and as a general fact people don't want to spend a lot of time on trivial things such as operating a thermostat.<br>
•	If a sink faucet was designed as an on/off switch, it would be likely that the sink faucet wouldn't be able to turn very far, just enough to give the signal it's 'on' would be all, that's how I, as a user, would be able to find out<br>
•	To test my design, I would test it by going around and asking people: This model I am holding is a design for a thermostat, how do you suppose it would operate? Please tell the first thought that pops into your mind about operating this thermostat.<br>

</td></tr>	
<tr><td><b>The design I came up with:</b><br><br> I made a simple drawing of how I would design a thermostat to prevent the common mistakes. <br> I made the design with a + and - button to increase temperature. Most users will figure out instantly that keeping it pressed for a while will 
make the temperature on the display rise faster, until it reaches the desired temperature. There is an OK button at the bottom to confirm the temperature, and the heating will be turned on. I designed it like this so people will not misunderstand the fact the temperature doesn't rise faster when a higher temperature
is set at first. The ok button is supposed to make users think it's an on/off kind of design. Of course, depending on the temperature you set, it will be on for a shorter or longer period of time.<td><IMG src="Temp.png" width="250" height="200"/></td></tr>
